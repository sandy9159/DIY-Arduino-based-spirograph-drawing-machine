Hello friends in this post I have made a spirograph drawing machine.

Spirograph is a geometric drawing device that produces mathematical roulette curves of the variety 

technically known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids. 


The well known toy version was developed by British engineer Denys Fisher and first sold in 1965.

The name has been a registered trademark of Hasbro Inc. since 1998 following purchase

of the company that had acquired the Denys Fisher company. 

The Spirograph brand was relaunched worldwide in 2013, with its original product configurations, by Kahootz Toys.

This board is basically controlling speed of DC motor 

We can control speed of 2 DC motor the wworking principle of of this board is very simple

one TIP 122 transistor is used for each motor this TIP 122 provided square wave to its based 

via IC 555 and we can modify this Square wave by rotating Potentiometer.

Means we can control the speed of DC motor by rotating potentiometer

I have mark the measurments on the MDF board and cut it accordingly using my hand saw cutter.

Then I mounted NEMA 17 stepper motor on the MDF board .

I bolted it with M3 50 mm Screw

Then I installed a mini 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor this motor is used to rotated the base table

This are the two arms of Spiro graph I have insterd a bearing in both of the arm and mounted it on the shaft of stepper motor

I have printed this parts in PLA filament with 50% infill density.
